# meteor-sidekiq

a simple meteorite package for [Atmosphere](https://atmosphere.meteor.com), providing a wrapper for the [node-sidekiq](https://github.com/loopj/node-sidekiq).

## How to install:
inside your project, run:  
    `$ meteor add dverba:sidekiq`

`dverba:sidekiq` exposes the `sidekiq` object, so its already available to you to implement wherever it makes sense to do so.
